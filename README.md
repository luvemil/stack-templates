# My Stack Templates

## three-layers-cake

Inspired by Matt Parsons' [Three Layers Haskell Cake](https://www.parsonsmatt.org/2018/03/22/three_layer_haskell_cake.html). This template is just an extract from [this web application template](https://github.com/Holmusk/three-layer) linked in the same article.

I encourage anyone who wants to use this template to look at the original instead, since this version lacks logging, error handling, a web server, and a proper application monad runner.
